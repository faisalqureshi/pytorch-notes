# lessons-pytorch

This is a collection of PyTorch notebooks that sets the stage for using PyTorch for deep learning development.  The web is full of excellent material on all things PyTorch.  I have tried to provide a link to the source material where warranted.

For questions please contact faisal.qureshi@ontariotechu.ca
